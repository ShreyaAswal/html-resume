<h1>THE BEST MOVIES ACCORDING TO SHREYA</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Seirra Burgass is a looser</h3>
<p>
  This movie is basically about a teenage girl, who has bodyshaming issues, as
  she was fat(or people called her that).This is a romantic genre movie, which
  tells us that all shapes and sizes are perfect, and there is no perfect body
  size to find love.

<h3>Kal Ho Naa Ho</h3>
<p>
  If you have not cried for so many days over anything, this is the movie you
  can watch!!!
</p>

<h3>Jab We Met</h3>
<p>Best rom-com movie I have ever watched.</p>
